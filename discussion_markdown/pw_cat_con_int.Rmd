### Pairwise Comparisons of Marginal Slopes

Pairwise comparisons between marginal slopes works essentially the same; once we can estimate the marginal slopes we want, we can test for equality
between them.

#### Example

As with the [categorical by categorical interaction](#categorical-interactions), we see that the regression coefficients on the interaction terms are
replicated in the pairwise comparisons, but we also get the additional comparison of the slopes in groups 2 versus 3.
