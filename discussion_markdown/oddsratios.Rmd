### Odds Ratios

Logistic regression model coefficients are log-odds, and are usually represented by odds ratios. While all the code given in this document work with
logistic models, the marginal effects are on the probability scale. That is, you are obtaining marginal predicted probability. For example, consider a
model with a binary outcome and a binary predictor. From the regression results, you could obtain an odds ratio describing the increase in odds of a
positive outcome when moving from group 0 to group 1, but the marginal results would estimate the probability of a positive outcome in each group.

While I would argue that predicted probabilites are more intepretable than odds ratios anyways, there may be scenarios where you would want to obtain
odds ratios. In particular, for a categorical predictor, you might wants odds ratios between each pair of levels.
