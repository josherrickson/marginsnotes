### Marginal Means for Continuous Variables

Marginal means for continuous variables actually operate the same as for categorical variables, in the sense that they are setting all observations to
a specific value of the continuous variable, then all predicted values are averaged.

Typically we obtain the marginal means over several meaningful values of the categorical variable to glimpse at the
relationship. [Plotting](#plotting) is extremely useful and always recommended when marginal effects for continuous variables are desired.

We can of course obtain marginal means with any number of variables fixed; in the example to the right we first obtain marginal means when "age" is at
certain values, then when "age" is at certain values and within each group.
