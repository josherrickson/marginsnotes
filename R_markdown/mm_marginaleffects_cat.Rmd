```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ group, data = m))
predictions(mod1, datagrid(group = unique))
marginalmeans(mod1, "group")
```

The `marginalmeans()` function is provided as a direct translation for `emmeans`
users. The `predictions()` function will be used more commonly so I recommend
becoming familiar with that.

The `datagrid()` function can be frustrating - putting in "wrong" values
produces no error/warning and just produces unexpected results. For example,

```{r}
predictions(mod1, datagrid(group = c(1, 2, 3)))
```

is an alternative to `group = unique` to specify the levels. (NOTE: These are
the "levels" not the values - it just happens that `group` has the same. See
[below](#factor-labels) for what happens when it differs.) We can specify a
subset of levels as well.

```{r}
predictions(mod1, datagrid(group = c(1, 2)))
```

However, what if we included a level that wasn't found in the model? For
example, if we thought `group` took on values 0-2 instead of 1-3?

```{r}
predictions(mod1, datagrid(group = c(0, 1, 2)))
```

In this case, the `newdata` argument (the second argument which `datagrid()`'s
results are passed to) is ignored without warning, and we get identical results
to if we'd just called `predictions(mod1)`.

#### Factor labels

If your factor has labels which are not just the values, you need to refer to
those.

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(y ~ sex, data = m)
summary(m$sex)
predictions(mod2, datagrid(sex = c(1,2)))
predictions(mod2, datagrid(sex = c("male", "female")))
```
