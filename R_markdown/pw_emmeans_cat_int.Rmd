```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ class*sex, data = m))
pairs(emmeans(mod1, ~ sex*class), adjust = "none")
```

The `adjust = "none"` argument skips any multiple comparisons correction. This
is done to obtain the same results as the regression coefficients. If you'd
prefer a more ANOVA post-hoc approach, there are other options for `adjust`, see
`?emmeans::contrast` for details.

This produces a lot of comparisons; if we only cared about the comparisons one
way (e.g. gender differences within each class), we can restrict our output to
these results.

```{r}
contrast(emmeans(mod1, ~ sex | class), "pairwise")
```

Note that the results are identical, it's just a nicer output.
