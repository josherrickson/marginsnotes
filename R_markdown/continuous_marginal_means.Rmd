For each unique level of the continuous variable, a seperate `emmeans` call is needed apparently. If anyone knows a way around this, please let me know.

```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ sex + age, data = m))
emmeans::emmeans(mod1, ~ 1, at = list(age = 30))
emmeans::emmeans(mod1, ~ 1, at = list(age = 40))
```

Note the use of `~ 1`. This argument (`spec`) cannot be excluded, but using `~ 1` basically ignores it and only focuses on the `at`.

```{r}
emmeans::emmeans(mod1, ~ sex, at = list(age = 30))
emmeans::emmeans(mod1, ~ sex, at = list(age = 40))
```
