```{r}
library(haven)
library(emmeans)
library(interactions)
```

```{r}
m <- haven::read_dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r15/margex.dta")
m <- data.frame(m)
m$sex <- as_factor(m$sex)
m$group <- as_factor(m$group)
head(m)
```

A note on syntax: To make clear which function belongs to which library, I've used R's [double
colon](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/ns-dblcolon.html) notation to be explicit. You do not need to include
these. E.g. `library::function()` can be run simply as `function()`. There's a bit of possible confusion in that the workhorse function `emmeans`,
belongs to the "emmeans" package, so `emmeans::emmeans` can be run as just `emmeans` to the right of the `::`.
