```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ group, data = m))
```

Note that `pairs` is a generic, meaning that `emmeans::pairs` is an
invalid call. Despite this, the "emmeans" package is required to call
the below.

```{r}
pairs(emmeans::emmeans(mod1, ~ group), adjust = "none")
```

The `adjust = "none"` argument skips any multiple comparisons
correction. This is done to obtain the same results as the regression
coefficients. If you'd prefer a more ANOVA post-hoc approach, there
are other options for `adjust`, see `?emmeans::contrast` for details.
