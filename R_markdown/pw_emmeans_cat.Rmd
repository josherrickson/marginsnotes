```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ class, data = m))
pairs(emmeans(mod1, ~ class), adjust = "none")
```

The `adjust = "none"` argument skips any multiple comparisons
correction. This is done to obtain the same results as the regression
coefficients. If you'd prefer a more ANOVA post-hoc approach, there
are other options for `adjust`, see `?emmeans::contrast` for details.
