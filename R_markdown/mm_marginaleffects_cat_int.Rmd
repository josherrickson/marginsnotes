```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ sex*class, data = m))
predictions(mod1, datagrid(sex = unique, class = unique))
marginalmeans(mod1, cross = TRUE)
```

The `marginalmeans()` function is provided as a direct translation for `emmeans`
users. The `predictions()` function will be used more commonly so I recommend
becoming familiar with that.
