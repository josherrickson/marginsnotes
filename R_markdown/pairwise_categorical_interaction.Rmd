```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ group*sex, data = m))
pairs(emmeans::emmeans(mod1, ~ sex*group), adjust = "none")
```

The `adjust = "none"` argument skips any multiple comparisons correction. This is done to obtain the same results as the regression coefficients. If
you'd prefer a more ANOVA post-hoc approach, there are other options for `adjust`, see `?emmeans::contrast` for details.

This produces a lot of comparisons; if we only cared about the comparisons one way (e.g. gender differences within each group), we can restrict our
output to these results.

```{r}
emmeans::contrast(emmeans::emmeans(mod1, ~ sex | group), "pairwise")
```

Note that the results are identical, it's just a nicer output.
