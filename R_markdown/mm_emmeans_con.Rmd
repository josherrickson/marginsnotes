Note that any variable specified in the `at` option must also appear in the formula. Any variables you place in the formula but not `at` will be
examined at each unique level (so don't put a continuous variable there!).

```{r}
summary(mod1 <- lm(y ~ sex + age + distance, data = m))
emmeans(mod1, ~ age, at = list(age = c(30, 40)))
test(emmeans(mod1, ~ age, at = list(age = c(30, 40))))
emmeans(mod1, ~ age + distance, at = list(age = c(30, 40), distance = c(10,100)))
emmeans(mod1, ~ age + sex, at = list(age = c(30, 40)))
```
