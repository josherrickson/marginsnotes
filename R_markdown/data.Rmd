The `haven` package is used to read the data from Stata into R.

```{r}
library(haven)
m <- read_dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r15/margex.dta")
m <- data.frame(m)
m$sex <- as_factor(m$sex)
names(m)[names(m) == "group"] <- "class"
m$class <- as_factor(m$class)
head(m)
```

The `marginaleffects` package doesn't like a variable being named "group", so we
rename it.
