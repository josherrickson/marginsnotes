Let's assume we have a binary variable, \(Z\), interacted with a continuous variable, \(X\).

\[
  E(Y|X,Z) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Z + \beta_3XZ
\]

Here we're combining the math from marginal effects with marginal slopes. First, we generate two equations, one for \(Z = 0\) and one for \(Z = 1\):

\begin{align*}
  E(Y|X, Z = 0) & = \beta_0 + \beta_1X \\
  E(Y|X, Z = 1) & = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2 + \beta_3X = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + (\beta_1 + \beta_3)X.
\end{align*}

Then when we differentiate each with respect to \(X\), we obtain \(\beta_1\) and \((\beta_1 + \beta_3)\) respectively.
