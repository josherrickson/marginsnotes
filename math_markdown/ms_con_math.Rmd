The Stata `margins` command to obtain marginal means includes the "`dydx`" option, which points to derivative - and indeed, this is exactly what is computed. If we have a basic regression model,

\[
  E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X
\]

taking the derivative with respect to \(X\) will obtain \(\beta_1\), which is the estimated coefficient.

If \(X\) enters the model in a more complex way, say a polynomial term:

\[
  E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2
\]

now the derivative is \(\beta_1 + 2\beta_2X\). Similar to marginal means, where the predicted outcome was estimated for each individual then those
outcomes averaged, here the derivative is estimated plugging in each observation's value of \(X\), then averaged.
